# Security Policy

All program code can be flawed or have vulnerabilities, even if you are very careful. 
We therefore ask you to send reports to this e-mail vaccaro.andrea45@gmail.com if anyone has identified problems in the code, bugs, vulnerabilities, etc.

Gapcast's priority is to document everything, try to make the code as clean as possible and of good quality. 
This is why it is important that if there are any problems, a report is made.

# The versions

During version updates, bugs or vulnerabilities are fixed and documented in the appropriate release. 
However, it can happen that they can escape, so regardless of the release you must **always update the program to the latest version if an update is present**.
