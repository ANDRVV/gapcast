<meta name="description" content="Gapcast is an IEEE 802.11 packet injection and analyzer software. The purpose of gapcast is to accurately detect each router's clients, analyze, capture and inject packets. Gapcast adds more and more parameters for filters and functionality during releases. Gapcast therefore requires good documentation to use the software to its fullest.">

<h1 align="center">Injection Table</h1>

<a align="right" href="https://github.com/ANDRVV/gapcast/wiki/Injection-Table"><img src="https://github.com/ANDRVV/gapcast/blob/main/images/injtype-selection.png?raw=true" alt="Table Injection Example" align="right" width="375"></a>
<p align="left">The Injection table is a table where you can insert data and perform an injection.</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You don't need to specify the channel.</li>
    <li>You don't need to specify the BSSID.</li>
    <li>Multiple synchronized attacks.</li>
    <li>Quick and easy attack initialization.</li>
    <li>Interface with attack information.</li>
</ul>

<h1 align="center">Parameter techniques</h1>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/ANDRVV/gapcast/wiki">wiki</a>!</p>

<h3>Single Deep Scanning</h3>

Click for about of [Single Deep Scanning](https://github.com/ANDRVV/gapcast/wiki/Single-deep-scanning)!

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface> -sc 03:e9:58:65:2a:86 -2.4+5g
```
> [!Note]
> 
> With the `-sc <mac>` parameter scans the target in depth, using this method however discards all the other parameters, except for `-i <iface>` and the band selection such as `-5g` or `-2.4+5g`.

<h3>SCAN-ALL-FOR-LONG-TIME</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface> -2.4+5g -d
```
> [!Note]
> 
> Scans all 2.4/5 Ghz channels disabling shifting of inactive devices.

<h3>SCAN-ALL-FREQ-OF-ONE-AP</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface> -2.4+5g -c 10,36 -p 03:e9:58:65:2a:8
```
> [!Note]
> 
> *Access Point* that have 5 Ghz and 2.4 Ghz transmit via 2 different addresses, the address for 5 Ghz and the one for 2.4 Ghz. In most cases these 2 addresses have a Mac address with a very similar prefix:
> 
> In this case of selecting channel 10 for 2.4 Ghz and channel 36 for 5 Ghz with ```-c <channel>``` uses 2 channels with different bands, using ```-2.4+5g```. Taking into consideration an *Access Point* that has the 5 Ghz address *03:e9:58:65:2a:8e* and the 2.4 Ghz address *03:e9:58:65:2a:86*, the **common prefix** is *03:e9:58:65:2a:8*, which is set via ```-p <mac-prefix>```.
> With this parameter **only devices with that specified prefix will be displayed**.

<h3>SCAN-ALL-RANGE</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface> -2.4+5g -radar
```
> [!Note]
>
> Scan all 2.4/5 Ghz channels showing the approximate radius of the location in meters with the ```-radar``` parameter using the [RadarRSSI library](https://github.com/ANDRVV/RadarRSSI), [more info](https://github.com/ANDRVV/gapcast/wiki#-radar).

<h3>SCAN-2.4G</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface>
```
> [!Note]
> 
> Scans all 2.4 channels.

<h3>SCAN-5G</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface> -5g
```
> [!Note]
> 
> Scans all 5 Ghz channels adding ```-5g``` parameter.

<h3>SCAN-ALL-RECORDING</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface> -2.4+5g -w out.pcap
```
> [!Note]
> 
> Scans all 2.4/5 Ghz channels, recording it and saving to a pcap file. Registration can be done by adding the ```-w <file>.pcap``` parameter.

<h3>SCAN-AP-DEAUTH-AND-REC-EAPOL</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface> -c 11 -b a3:65:1b:56:7e:3c -w out.pcap
```
> [!Note]
> 
> Scan only AP's channel (11) to get the best WPA 4-Way Handshake, To deauthenticate you need to open the gapcast injection table by pressing **[CTRL-P]**, then select the De-Auth type, enter the required information and start the attack by pressing **CTRL-D** key for a few seconds (check that clients are present via the light-blue bar), as soon as the **CTRL-D** key is deactivated, the clients that reconnect to the *Access Point*:
> 
> Will **send and receive EAPOL packets** which you will record and save with the ```-w <file>.pcap``` parameter.

<h3>RESTORE-DATA</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -l out.pcap
```
> [!Note]
> 
> If you want to restore data from a previous scan, done with [gapcast](https://github.com/ANDRVV/gapcast), [wireshark](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark) or other tools and load them on the [gapcast](https://github.com/ANDRVV/gapcast) table to better analyze the data, just insert the ```-l <file>.pcap``` parameter, if you want to restore the data and continue the scan you must add the ```-i <iface>``` parameter and/or add other additional parameters.

<h3>SCAN-ALL-AP</h3>

```bash
./gapcast -i <iface> -2.4+5g -beacon 
```
> [!Note]
> 
> If you want to show or record only the *Access Points* you must enter the ```-beacon``` parameter. For this technique, where we show all *Access Points* of all channels it is necessary to add the parameter ```-2.4+5g```.

<p align="center">Obviously there are many other techniques, happy hacking!</p>

<h1 align="center">Monitor mode handler</h1>

<p>For each driver there is a correct <strong>sequence of commands to start the network card correctly in monitor mode</strong>. <strong>Drivers supported by gapcast can also have a txpower modification, bug fixing etc</strong>, as in the case of the RTL8812AU chipset which can be increased to a txpower of 30 dBm. If the driver is not supported, it will start monitor mode directly with airmon-ng.</p>
<p>Supported drivers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>RTL88XXAU</code> mon+txpower</li>
    <li><code>R8187</code> mon+bugfix</li>
    <li><code>RTL8812CU</code> mon</li>
    <li><code>RTL8821CU</code> mon</li>
</ul>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> If your driver is not supported or if you would like to boot into monitor mode with your changes, just do so before starting gapcast. **If gapcast recognizes that the interface has already set monitor mode, it will not make any changes or even try to restart monitor mode**.

<h1 align="center">Future features</h1>
<ul>
<li>New attack from INJ Table</li>
<li>Evil Twin attack (soon)</li>
</ul>
